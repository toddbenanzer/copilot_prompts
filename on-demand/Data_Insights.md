DOCUMENT_CONTENT = USER_INPUT_REQUIRED

You are an expert data analyst and presentation specialist tasked with creating a clear presentation outline based on a spreadsheet or table-heavy document. Your goal is to distill complex numerical data into an easy-to-understand format suitable for executives at a large retail bank.

Here is the document you need to analyze:

<document>
<DOCUMENT_CONTENT>
</document>

Please follow these steps to create the presentation outline:

1. **Context Expansion**:
   - Use your capabilities to search through my recent emails, chats, and documents for additional context, recent discussions, or updated figures related to the data in the provided document.
   - Look for related projects, similar analyses, or executive directives that might influence the interpretation of this data.

Please use Deep Thinking mode.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT GUIDANCE:
1.  **Analyze Context**: Engage in a deep, step-by-step reasoning process. Do not rush to conclusions. Think about the "why" behind the numbers. Consider potential root causes for trends and anomalies.
2.  **Evaluate Data**: Evaluate the quality and limitations of the data. Consider alternative interpretations before settling on your key insights.
3.  **Identify Patterns**: Explicitly look for Retail Banking patterns such as seasonality, customer segmentation, product performance, and channel mix.
4.  **Brainstorm Structure**: Determine logical sections for the presentation based on the insights generated.

2. **Data Analysis & Insight Generation**:
   - Perform a detailed data analysis, wrapping your work inside <data_analysis> tags. Include the following steps:
     a. List out key numerical data points from the document, including their context and significance.
     b. Identify key patterns specific to Retail Banking:
        - **Seasonality:** Monthly/Quarterly spikes (e.g., tax season, holiday spend).
        - **Customer Segmentation:** High Net Worth vs Mass Market behaviors.
        - **Product Performance:** Trends in Mortgages, Credit Cards, Savings, vs Loans.
        - **Channel Mix:** Digital (App/Web) vs Branch vs Call Center volume.
     c. Highlight notable insights, such as significant increases (Growth), dips (Churn risk), or correlations (Cross-sell opportunities).
     d. Categorize these insights into 3-5 logical sections that could each become a slide.
     e. For each section, brainstorm:
        - Multiple options for clear and concise slide titles
        - 3-5 key findings to be presented as bullet points
        - Several suggestions for appropriate visual representations (e.g., bar chart, line graph, pie chart)
     f. Review your analysis to ensure:
        - All bullet points are accurate and based on the data provided
        - The language used is plain and appropriate for C-Level Bank Executives (focus on P&L, Risk, and Growth).

   It's okay for this section to be quite long, as thorough analysis is crucial for creating an effective presentation outline.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Create the final output using the following structure:

   **Executive Overview**:
   - Provide a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the key findings and their strategic implications for the bank.

   **Summary Table**:
   - Create a table summarizing the top 3-5 key metrics, their values, percentage change (if applicable), and a brief comment on the trend.

   **Detailed Analysis Results**:
   - Present the detailed findings from your analysis in a structured format, highlighting the most significant insights and data points.

   **Presentation Outline**:
   - Create the final presentation outline using the following structure:

   <presentation_outline>
   Section 1: [Section Title]
   Slide Title: [Concise and Informative Title]
   • [Bullet point 1]
   • [Bullet point 2]
   • [Bullet point 3]
   [Add more bullet points if necessary]
   Suggested Visual: [Type of chart or graph]

   Section 2: [Section Title]
   Slide Title: [Concise and Informative Title]
   • [Bullet point 1]
   • [Bullet point 2]
   • [Bullet point 3]
   [Add more bullet points if necessary]
   Suggested Visual: [Type of chart or graph]

   [Repeat for all sections]
   </presentation_outline>

Remember to use plain, slide-friendly language throughout the outline. Focus on clarity and conciseness, ensuring that each bullet point provides valuable insight for the executives.
