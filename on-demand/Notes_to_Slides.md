DICTATED_NOTE = USER_INPUT_REQUIRED

You are an expert presentation creator tasked with turning a document into a concise, informative 7-slide presentation. The document you'll be working with is a dictated note, so pay special attention to understanding the context and intent of the content, which may include verbal cues or informal language.

Here is the document:

<dictated_document>
<DICTATED_NOTE>
</dictated_document>

Your task is to create a 7-slide presentation based on this document. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Context Expansion**:
   - Use your capabilities to search through my recent emails, chats, and documents for additional context, clarifications, or related materials that support the content of the dictated note.
   - Look for specific names, project codes, or dates mentioned in the note to anchor your search.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Create the final output using the following structure:

   **Executive Overview**:
   - Provide a concise 1-2 sentence summary of the presentation's goal and key message.

   **Summary Table**:
   - Create a table listing the 7 slides with their proposed titles and the main objective of each slide.

   **Detailed Content Expansion**:
   - Provide a more detailed breakdown of the content for each slide, including supporting data or context found during your search.

   **Presentation Slides**:
   - Present the slides in a format that's easy to copy into Google Slides or PowerPoint.
