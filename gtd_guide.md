# Executive GTD for Banking: High-Performance Workflow Guide

This guide adapts David Allen’s *Getting Things Done* (GTD) methodology specifically for a **Retail Banking Executive**. In a high-stakes, regulated environment, "Mind Like Water" isn't just about stress reduction—it's about Audit Readiness, Risk Management, and Strategic Clarity.

## 🏦 The Banking Executive Context

Standard GTD contexts (e.g., @Home, @Errands) do not apply to your world. Instead, your workflow is driven by **Stakeholder Contexts** and **Risk Horizons**.

### 1. Executive Contexts (The "Where" and "Who")

When processing tasks with Copilot, categorize them into these banking-specific contexts:

*   **@Regulator / @Audit**: Tasks related to MRAs (Matters Requiring Attention), SLA breaches, or Compliance reports. *Priority: Critical.*
*   **@Committee**: Items for SteerCo, Risk Committee, or Board Prep. Requires formal documentation.
*   **@Team_Pulse**: 1:1s, resource allocation, and "Change the Bank" project oversight.
*   **@Vendor**: Managing third-party risk, contract renewals (Adobe, Salesforce, AWS), and performance reviews.
*   **@Deep_Work**: Strategic planning, "Buy vs Build" analysis, and narrative generation.

## 🔄 The 5 Stages of Executive Workflow

### 1. Capture (The "Commitment Scan")
*Goal: Catch every promise made to a regulator, boss, or peer.*

In banking, a missed email isn't just annoying; it can be a regulatory breach.
*   **Copilot Prompt:** Use **Prompt E3 (Commitment Scan)** to scrape emails for "implied promises" and "direct asks."
*   **Best Practice:** Never leave a "Head nod" in a meeting undocumented. Use **Prompt T3 (Decision Audit Log)** to capture it immediately.

### 2. Clarify (The "Risk Filter")
*Goal: Decide if an input is "Run the Bank" (Delegate) or "Change the Bank" (Lead).*

*   **Is it Actionable?**
    *   *No:* Is it Reference (Compliance Policy)? Trash (Vendor Spam)? Or Incubate (Q4 Idea)?
    *   *Yes:* **Delegate** if it's "Run the Bank" (Routine). **Lead** if it's "Change the Bank" (Strategy).
*   **Copilot Prompt:** Use **Prompt E1 (Delegation Assistant)** to instantly draft delegation emails for routine operational tasks.

### 3. Organize (The "Banking Priority Matrix")
*Goal: Balance the tension between Innovation and Compliance.*

Standard "Urgent/Important" matrices fail in banking because *everything* feels urgent. Use the **Reg vs Growth** split.
*   **Must Do:** Regulatory Deadlines, Audit Findings, Incidents. (Protect the Bank)
*   **Should Do:** Campaign Optimization, New Model Dev. (Grow the Bank)
*   **Copilot Prompt:** Use **Prompt N1 (Banking Priority Matrix)** to visualize this split for your team every Monday.

### 4. Reflect (The "Weekly Risk Review")
*Goal: ensuring you aren't blind to model drift or attrition.*

A weekly review is your safety net.
*   **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):** Check Model Risk, Data Quality, and Attrition.
*   **Horizon Scan:** What regulation is coming next quarter (Basel, AI Act)?
*   **Copilot Prompt:** Use **Prompt N2 (Performance & Risk Review)** and **Prompt N8 (Regulatory Horizon Scan)**.

### 5. Engage (The "Strategic Brief")
*Goal: Communicate with precision to the C-Suite.*

Executives speak the language of **Capital** and **Risk**.
*   **Output:** Never send raw data. Send "Action Titles" and "Financial Impact."
*   **Copilot Prompt:** Use **Prompt N6 (C-Suite Strategic Brief)** and **Prompt N7 (Attribution Analysis)** to translate analytics into business value.

## 🚀 Advanced Banking Workflows

### The "Audit Trail" Protocol
In regulated environments, *why* you made a decision is as important as *what* you decided.
*   **Rule:** Every strategic meeting must generate a Decision Log.
*   **Tool:** Use **Prompt T3** to capture "Rationale," "Alternatives Considered," and "Approver."

### The "Pre-Mortem" Simulation
Before launching a new product or model, assume it failed.
*   **Prompt:** "Act as a regulator. Review this project plan and identify 3 reasons you would issue an MRA (Matter Requiring Attention) against it."

### The "Vendor Health" Check
Don't let third-party risk become your risk.
*   **Routine:** Monthly review of vendor SLAs and data privacy compliance.
*   **Tool:** Use **Prompt T1 (Team Pulse)** to ask specifically about "Vendor Issues."
