CRITICAL_OUTCOME = USER_INPUT_REQUIRED

Act as my Chief of Staff. It is midday. Review my morning activity (sent emails, attended meetings), my remaining calendar for today, and any new urgent requests in my inbox. Help me re-calibrate my day to ensure I achieve <CRITICAL_OUTCOME>.

<DEEP_THINKING>
Please use Deep Thinking mode.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT GUIDANCE:
1.  **Audit Progress**: Review sent emails and calendar history from this morning to determine what was actually completed versus planned.
2.  **Scan New Inputs**: Identify any high-priority emails or chat requests that arrived since the morning briefing.
3.  **Capacity Check**: Calculate the actual number of "Deep Work" hours remaining in the day, accounting for fixed meetings.
4.  **Triage & Trade-offs**: rigorous comparison of the <CRITICAL_OUTCOME> against new requests. Identify low-leverage tasks to delegate, defer to tomorrow, or delete entirely.
5.  **Re-plan**: Construct a realistic, time-blocked schedule for the remainder of the day that prioritizes the critical outcome and batches smaller tasks.
