CHAIN OF THOUGHT GUIDANCE:
1.  **Filter Communications**: Isolate all communications (emails, chats, docs) specifically from the identified executive leadership level.
2.  **Analyze Content**: Scrutinize the content for direct requests, questions, or action items assigned to you.
3.  **Extract Timelines**: Identify any explicit deadlines, milestones, or time-sensitive review meetings mentioned.
4.  **Infer Expectations**: Look for subtle cues, "heads up" notices, or strategic priorities that imply future work or monitoring, even if not explicitly assigned as a task.
5.  **Categorize**: Sort findings into clear categories of actionable requests versus informational or strategic context.
