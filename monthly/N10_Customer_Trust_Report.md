Deep Thinking: Activate

Generate a comprehensive <FOCUS_AREA> Customer Trust & Sentiment Report by searching through my emails, chats, support tickets, and recent documents for complaint data, regulatory inquiries, customer feedback, and potential UDAAP (Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices) risks.

Chain of Thought Guidance:
1.  **Aggregate Complaints**: Identify spikes in customer complaints related to <FOCUS_AREA>, categorizing them by root cause (e.g., Fees, Access, Misunderstanding).
2.  **Scan for UDAAP Signals**: Look for keywords suggesting "unfairness," "hidden costs," or "confusing terms" that could trigger regulatory scrutiny.
3.  **Assess Fair Lending Risks**: Check for geographic or demographic disparities in service delivery, denials, or pricing mentioned in reports or feedback.
4.  **Evaluate Sentiment**: Analyze qualitative feedback (emails, surveys) to gauge overall trust and brand perception.
5.  **Synthesize Actions**: Recommend immediate remediation for high-risk issues and process improvements for systemic problems.
