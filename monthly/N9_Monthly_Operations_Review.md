Deep Thinking: Activate

Generate a comprehensive <TEAM_SCOPE> monthly operations review by searching through my emails, chats, and recent documents for updates on talent/hiring, infrastructure costs (FinOps), technical debt, and vendor performance.

Chain of Thought Guidance:
1.  **Assess Talent Health**: Identify signals of burnout, key person dependencies, and hiring gaps. Look for mentions of "too much work," "single point of failure," or "turnover."
2.  **Evaluate Infrastructure & FinOps**: Analyze discussions around cloud spend, budget variances, and unit economics (e.g., cost per transaction/inference).
3.  **Review Technical Health**: Scan for technical debt accumulation, "hacky" fixes, and "buy vs build" decisions.
4.  **Monitor Vendor Performance**: Check for issues with major MarTech vendors (e.g., Adobe, Salesforce), SLA breaches, or renewal discussions.
5.  **Synthesize Risks**: Combine findings into a holistic view of operational stability and efficiency.
