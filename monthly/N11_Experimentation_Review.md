Deep Thinking: Activate

Generate a comprehensive <INNOVATION_SCOPE> Experimentation & Innovation Review by searching through my emails, chats, and recent documents for A/B test results, hypothesis logs, pilot outcomes, and "Change the Bank" initiative updates.

Chain of Thought Guidance:
1.  **Assess Experimentation Velocity**: Calculate the number of experiments launched vs. planned. Identify bottlenecks in the testing pipeline.
2.  **Evaluate Win Rates**: Analyze the success rate of experiments. Distinguish between "Statistically Significant Wins," "Flat," and "Losses."
3.  **Synthesize Learnings**: Extract key strategic insights from both wins and failures. What did we learn about customer behavior?
4.  **Track "Change the Bank" Progress**: Review the status of major innovation projects vs. "Run the Bank" maintenance work.
5.  **Recommend Actions**: Suggest scaling winning experiments or pivoting from losing strategies.

Output Structure:

### Executive Overview
(1-2 sentences summarizing the innovation velocity, win rate, and top strategic learning for the month.)
