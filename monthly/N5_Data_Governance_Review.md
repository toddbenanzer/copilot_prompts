GOVERNANCE_SCOPE = USER_INPUT_REQUIRED

Deep Thinking: Activate

Generate a monthly <GOVERNANCE_SCOPE> governance status report by searching through my emails, chats, and recent documents for keywords related to <GOVERNANCE_SCOPE>, compliance reports, audit findings, and data quality metrics.

Chain of Thought Guidance:
