GOVERNANCE_TYPE = USER_INPUT_REQUIRED

Deep Thinking: Activate

Generate a monthly <GOVERNANCE_TYPE> governance status report by searching through my emails, chats, and recent documents for keywords related to <GOVERNANCE_TYPE>, compliance reports, audit findings, and data quality metrics.

Chain of Thought Guidance:
1.  **Analyze**: Scan gathered information to identify relevant quality metrics, validation status, audit readiness, and privacy compliance issues.
2.  **Cross-reference**: Check audit logs against recent communication to pinpoint unresolved issues.
3.  **Synthesize**: Summarize key findings into an executive overview and detailed metrics, populating the specific metric names and values based on the data found.

Output Structure:

### Executive Overview
