Act as a strategic advisor. Deeply analyze my recent emails, chats, and documents from the past quarter to develop a <TIME_PERIOD> <TECHNOLOGY_TYPE> strategy roadmap.

**Chain of Thought Guidance:**
1.  **Analyze Context:** Review all communications and documents to identify key themes, recurring challenges, and strategic discussions related to <TECHNOLOGY_TYPE>.
2.  **Identify Gaps:** Compare current capabilities against the strategic goals mentioned or implied in the source materials.
3.  **Synthesize Plan:** Develop a phased roadmap that addresses these gaps and aligns with the identified priorities.
4.  **Evaluate Risks:** Assess potential risks and required investments based on the context.

**Output Structure:**

1.  **Executive Overview:** A 1-2 sentence high-level summary of the proposed strategy.
2.  **Summary Table:** A table highlighting the key initiatives, priority, and estimated impact.
3.  **Detailed Results:**

CAPABILITY GAP ANALYSIS:
Current State | Target State | Priority | Effort Level

TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP:
Phase 1 (<TIMEFRAME_1>): <INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPE> needs
Phase 2 (<TIMEFRAME_2>): <IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE> implementation
Phase 3 (<TIMEFRAME_3>): <CAPABILITY_TYPE> capabilities

TEAM DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
Team Member | Current Skills | Target Skills | Training Plan | Timeline

SUCCESS METRICS BY PHASE:
<MILESTONE_1>: <Target> | Success Criteria | Risk Mitigation

BUSINESS CASE:
- Investment Required: Total cost breakdown
- Expected Benefits: Quantified <BENEFIT_TYPE>
- Risk Assessment: Likelihood and impact
