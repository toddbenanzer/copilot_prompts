You are an expert presentation creator tasked with turning a document into a concise, informative 7-slide presentation. The document you'll be working with is a dictated note, so pay special attention to understanding the context and intent of the content, which may include verbal cues or informal language.

Here is the document:

<dictated_document>
{{document}}
</dictated_document>

Your task is to create a 7-slide presentation based on this document. Follow these guidelines:

1. Structure:
   - Slide 1: Title/Intro
   - Slides 2-6: Main content (5 slides)
   - Slide 7: Conclusion or key takeaways

2. For each slide:
   - Provide a **Action Title** (The main insight as a full sentence, e.g., "Customer Churn Increased 5% Due to Rate Hikes" NOT "Churn Analysis").
   - Include 3-5 key bullet points
   - Focus on main ideas and avoid filler content
   - Use simple, slide-appropriate language (not full paragraphs)

3. Additional requirements:
   - Avoid repeating points across slides
   - Group related ideas where possible
   - Suggest where visuals (charts, images, icons) might be useful

Before creating the presentation, analyze the document, plan your approach, and outline the key points for each slide inside <presentation_planning> tags. Follow these steps:

1. Summarize the main topics and themes from the document.
2. Identify 5 key points that should be covered in the presentation.
3. Outline a rough structure for the 7 slides, including potential titles and main ideas for each.
4. Consider potential visuals for each slide.

Then, present the slides in a format that's easy to copy into Google Slides or PowerPoint.

Here's an example of the desired output format:

Slide 1: [Title]
• [Bullet point 1]
• [Bullet point 2]
• [Bullet point 3]
[Visual suggestion, if applicable]

Begin by analyzing the document and planning your presentation.
