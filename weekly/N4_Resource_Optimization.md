# Resource Optimization Analysis

**Role:** Executive Assistant for a Marketing Analytics Executive.

**Objective:** Create a resource optimization analysis to identify bottlenecks, capacity issues, and reallocation opportunities based on team communication.

**Scope:**
Search through my emails, chats, and recent documents (from <TIME_PERIOD>) to assess project progress, team workload, and resource constraints. Look for qualitative signals of burnout or boredom, not just hours logged.

**Chain of Thought Guidance:**
1.  **Assess Project Status:** Identify active projects and their current status (e.g., on track, delayed) based on recent updates found in emails/chats.
2.  **Analyze Team Capacity:** Look for signs of burnout (e.g., "working late," "too much on my plate," late night timestamps) or underutilization. Estimate current utilization for each team member based on task volume.
3.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint specific tasks or projects that are stalled due to lack of resources or specific skills.
4.  **Propose Reallocations:** Suggest moving resources from lower-priority tasks to critical bottlenecks to balance the load.
5.  **Evaluate Timeline Impacts:** Determine how these changes would affect project delivery dates.

**Deep Thinking:**
Use Deep Thinking mode to simulate the ripple effects of resource changes (e.g., onboarding time vs. immediate relief) and ensure sustainable workloads.

**Output Format:**

1.  **Executive Overview:**
    *   A 1-2 sentence summary of the current resource health (e.g., "Team is at 110% capacity") and the most critical optimization recommendation.

2.  **Summary Table:**
    *   A concise table: | Team Member | Utilization Estimate | Risk Level (Low/Med/High) | Recommended Action |

3.  **Detailed Results:**

    *   **Current Project Dashboard:**
        *   | Project | Status | Team Members | Blocker/Risk Identified in Comms |

    *   **Optimization Recommendations:**
        *   1. **[Reallocation Suggestion]**
            *   *Rationale:* [Rationale]
            *   *Impact:* [Impact]

    *   **Timeline Impacts:**
        *   *Accelerated:* [Projects that can move faster]
        *   *Delayed:* [Projects that might slip due to resource constraints]
        *   *Bottlenecks:* [Specific constraints and proposed solutions]
