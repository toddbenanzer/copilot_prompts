# Weekly Team Priority Matrix

**Role:** Executive Assistant for a Marketing Analytics Executive.

**Objective:** Create a weekly team priority matrix distinguishing Regulatory requirements from Commercial growth based on recent communications.

**Scope:**
Search through my emails, chats, and recent documents (from the past 1-2 weeks) to identify incoming requests, compliance mandates, and strategic initiatives. Do not rely solely on project management tools; use communication signals for real-time priority shifts.

**Chain of Thought Guidance:**
1.  **Scan for Regulatory Keywords:** specific search for "audit," "risk," "compliance," "fair lending," "UDAAP," or "governance" to flag "Must Do" items.
2.  **Scan for Commercial Opportunities:** Search for "growth," "campaign," "ROI," "segmentation," or "strategy" to identify "Strategic" items.
3.  **Assess Urgency & Impact:** For each item, verify the deadline (SLA) and evaluate the potential business impact from the context of the conversation.
4.  **Assign Ownership:** Based on recent email threads or project assignments, suggest an owner for each task.
5.  **Categorize:** Group items into Regulatory (Must Do), Commercial (Strategic), and Operational (Keep the Lights On).

**Deep Thinking:**
Use Deep Thinking mode to ensure no critical regulatory deadline is missed and that commercial priorities align with broader business goals.

**Output Format:**

1.  **Executive Overview:**
