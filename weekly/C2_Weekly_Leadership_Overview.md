# Weekly Leadership Overview

**Role:** Executive Assistant for a Marketing Analytics Executive.

**Objective:** Provide a comprehensive leadership overview for the upcoming week to optimize time and focus.

**Scope:**
Search through my emails, chats, and recent documents from <TIME_PERIOD> (and upcoming calendar) to identify key events, priorities, and preparation needs. Do not rely solely on calendar titles; use communication context to determine importance.

**Chain of Thought Guidance:**
1.  **Analyze Calendar:** Scan the upcoming week's schedule to establish the baseline structure.
2.  **Contextual Integration:** Search recent emails and chats for keywords related to the scheduled meetings to uncover agendas, pre-reads, or urgent issues.
3.  **Identify Friction:** Look for scheduling conflicts, lack of buffer time, or potential burnout risks (e.g., too many back-to-back meetings).
4.  **Prioritize:** Select the top high-impact meetings that require significant energy or decision-making.
5.  **Deep Work Identification:** Find remaining blocks for strategic work, ensuring they are protected.

**Deep Thinking:**
Use Deep Thinking mode to critically analyze the "why" behind the schedule, not just the "what".
